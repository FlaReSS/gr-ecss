     * \param samp Sampling rate of signal.
     * \param damp damping factor.
     * \param n_freq natural frequency.
     * \param m index m for a third order filter.
     *
     * \details This block generates a complex output signal which is the complex multiplication between the input and the reference signal generated by PLL.
     * The ecss PLL provide in output the value of frequency (expressed in Hz) of the internal reference signal, the output of the phase detector (espressed in rad in range [-pi; pi]) and the int64 value of the internal integer accumulator (useful for the ecss coherent phase accumulator).
     * Furthermore, this block allows to reduce the accuracy (setting the number of bits N) of the mathematics in order to simulate properly a real behavior.
